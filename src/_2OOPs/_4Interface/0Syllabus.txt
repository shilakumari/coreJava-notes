Summary

Abstract class use cases
We want to share code among several closely related classes.
We expect that classes that extend your abstract class have many common methods or fields 
	or require access modifiers other than public.
We want to declare non-static or non-final fields, enabling us to define methods that can access & modify the state of the object to which they belong.

Interface Use cases
We expect that unrelated classes would implement our interface.
We want to specify the behaviour of a particular data type, but not concerned about who implements its behaviour.
We want to take advantage of multiple inheritance of type


An interface can extends any number of interface simultaneously.

As every interface methods are always public and abstract, we cannot declare interface method with the following modifiers:
	private 
	protected	 
	final
	synchronized
	strictfp
	native
	<default>
	static

As every interface variable is always public , static , final .
We cann't declare with the following modifiers:
private 
protected
transient 
Volatile

Q ) Is a java class can implement any number of interface simultaneously.
Ans ) Yes, a particular case. 
	If two interface contains a method with same signature but diff return types(not co-varient also). 
	Then it is impossible to implements both interface simultaneously.
