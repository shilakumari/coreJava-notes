Method Overriding/Dynamic polymorphism/Runtime polymorphism/Late binding or dynamic method dispatch

If child class not satisfied with parent class implementation 
	then child is allowed to redefined that method based on its requirement. 
This process is called method overriding.
It is also called as run-time polymorphism.
class P {
	public void property() {
		System.out.println("Cash" + " Gold" + " Land");
	}
	public void marry() {
		System.out.println("Subha Lakshmi");
	}
}
class C extends P {
	public void marry() {
		System.out.println("Aishwarya");
	}
}
The parent class method which is overridden is called overridden method.
The child class method which is overriding is called overriding method.

Compiler rule
Compiler is always going to syntactically. 
In case of P p1=new P(); p1.m1();, compiler sees that p1 is of p type and it check whether P has method m1() or not. 

But JVM  will check whether run time object is child object or parent object. 
If it is child object, then, it will check, in the child class, whether child class is overriding or not. 
If it is overriding, based on the runtime object, JVM will execute child class method.
If it is not overriding, based on the runtime object, JVM will execute parent class method.

In method overriding, method resolution always take care by JVM, based on runtime object. 
And hence overriding is also considered as runtime polymorphism or dynamic polymorphism or late binding or dynamic method dispatch.
In method overloading method resolution always take care by compiler, based on reference  type.
		P p1 = new P();
		p1.marry();//Parent

		C c1 = new C();
		c1.marry();//Child

		P p2 = new C();
		p2.marry();//Child
		
		// C c2=new P();//CTE

	
Rules for overriding
Overriding is a complex process not like overloading, which is simpler than overriding.
Example:Love marriage
1)In method overriding, method signature must be same.
2)In method overriding, co-varient return type(1.5v).
		javac -source 1.4 P.java
	For primitive type, co-varient return type concept is not applicable. It  is only applicable for object type.  																			
  Return type of Parent class method	Object							Number				String				double
  Return type of Child class method		Object/String/StringBuffer...	Number/Integer/		Object(Invalid)		int(invalid)
		
3)Parent class private method not available to the child and hence overriding concept is not applicable for private methods. 
  It is like fantasy marriage in teen age by child and parent both.
  We can define exactly same private method in child class. It is valid but not overriding.
	class P{
		private void m1(){}
	}
	class C extends P{
		private void m1(){}
	}	
  It is valid but not overriding.
	
4) Final method cann't be overridden. It is like child marriage.
class P {
	public void property() {
		System.out.println("Cash" + " Gold" + " Land");
	}
	public final void marry() {
		System.out.println("Subha Lakshmi");
	}
}
class C extends P {
	public void marry() {
		System.out.println("Aishwarya");
	}
}

5) Parent class non-abstract method can be overridden in child class as a abstract method.
Advantage-We can stop, the availability of parent method implementation to next level child classes.
class P {
	public  void property() {
		System.out.println("Cash" + " Gold" + " Land");
	}
}
abstract class C extends P {
	public abstract void marry();
}

6)
Parent class(or interface) abstract method should be implemented  in child class to provide implementation. 
But if not implemented then child class must be declare abstract(Example-childish behavior) 
and we can also again declare same abstract method in child class.

7)
Parent Method	final						non-final	abstract				non-abstract	synchronized	non-synchronized	native	    non-native		strictfp		non-strictfp
Child Method	non-final/final(Invalid)	final		abstract/non-abstract	abstract     	non-synchronized	synchronized	non-native	native			non-strictfp	strictfp

Method hashcode() of Object class, is a native method.

8)
While overriding, we cannâ€™t reduce scope of access modifier. But we can increase the scope.
Overriding concept is not applicable for private method.
Private<default<protected<public
class P {
	public void marry() {
		System.out.println("Subha Lakshmi");
	}
}
class C extends P {
	protected void marry() {//invalid,
		System.out.println("Aishwarya");
	}
}
output:CTE

Parent class method		public		protected			<default>						private
Child class method		public		protected/public	<default>/protected/public		Overriding  not  applicable
Overriding concept is not applicable for private method.


Why access modifier scope can be increased only
	Our overriding should not affect outside people.
	P p1 = new C();
	p1.m1();
 	class P{
 	...	void m1(){}
 	}
	class C extends P{
		public void m1(){}
	}
	

If child class method throws any checked exception then parent class method must throw same checked exception 
	or its parent exception. Otherwise we will get CTE.
	But there are no restriction for unchecked exception.
 
	1)P: public void m1() throws Exception
	  C: public void m1()
	  //Valid6
	  
	2)P: public void m1() 
	  C: public void m1() throws Exception
	  //Invalid
	  
	3)P: public void m1() throws Exception
	  C: public void m1() throws IOException
	  //Valid
	  
	4)P: public void m1() throws IOException
	  C: public void m1() throws Exception
	  //Invalid
	  
	5)P: public void m1() throws IOException
	  C: public void m1() throws FileNotFoundException, EOFException
	  //valid
	  
	6)P: public void m1() throws IOException
	  C: public void m1() throws EOFException
	  //Valid
	  
	7)P: public void m1() throws IOException
	  C: public void m1() throws ArithmeticException, NullPointerException
	  //valid
	  
	 Our overriding should not affect outside people.
	 P p1 = new C();
	 try{
	 	p1.m1();
	 }catch(IOException e){}
	
	 P: public void m1() throws IOException
	 C: public void m1() 
	  //Valid
	 
9)Overriding w.r.t. Static methods
We cannâ€™t override static method as non-static. Otherwise we will get CTE.
We cannâ€™t override non-static method as static. Otherwise we will get CTE.

If both parent & child class methods are static method then we will not get any CTE. 
Its seems overriding concept is applicable for static methods. But it is not method overriding, it is method hiding.
		P p1 = new P();
		p1.marry();

		C c1 = new C();
		c1.marry();

		P p2 = new C();
		p2.marry();// Parent 

		// C c2=new P();//CTE
 
Method hiding

Diff b/w Method hiding and overriding
All rules of method hiding is exactly same as overriding except the following differences:
 Method Hiding												Method Overriding
 1)Both static												1)Both non-static
 2)Method resolution at compile time using reference 		2)Method resolution at run time by JVM using runtime object
 3)Compile time polymorphism/static binding/ early binding	3)Run time polymorphism/ Dynamic binding/ Late binding
 
If both parent & child method are non-static then it will become overriding.

In method hiding both copies of methods are available but in case of overriding only child method copy is available.
C c1 = new C();
c1.marry();//Child

P p2 = new C();
p2.marry();// Parent   


Overriding w.r.t. Var-arg methods
We can override var-arg method with another ver-arg method only. If we are trying to override with normal method 
	then it will become overloading not overriding. 
public class MethodOverriding {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		P p1 = new P();
		p1.m1();// Parent
		p1.m1(10);// Parent

		C c1 = new C();
		c1.m1();// parent
		c1.m1(10);// Child

		P p2 = new C();
		p2.m1();// Parent
		p2.m1(10);// Parent
		// C c2=new P();//CTE
	}
}
class P {
	public void m1(int... a) {
		System.out.println("Parent");
	}
}
class C extends P {
	public void m1(int b) {
		System.out.println("Child");
	}
}
In the above program, if we replace child method with var-arg method, then it will become overriding. 



Overriding w.r.t variable
Variable resolution, always takes care by compiler based on reference type, 
  irrespective of whether the variable is static or non-static.
(Overriding concept is only applicable for method but not for variable).
public class MethodOverriding {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		P p1 = new P();
		System.out.println(p1.x);// Parent
		C c1 = new C();
		System.out.println(c1.x);//Child
		P p2 = new C();
		System.out.println(p2.x);//Parent
		// C c2=new P();//CTE
	}
}
class P {
	int x = 888;
}
class C extends P {
	int x = 999;
}


Diff b/w overloading & overriding
In overloading, we have to check only method name(must be same) and argument types(must be different). 
In overloading, we are not required to check remaining like return type, access modifier etc. 
But in overriding, everything we have to check, like method name, argument type, return type, access modifier, throws clause etc.

Property					Overloading											Overriding
Method name					Must same											Must same
Parameter Type				Must diff											Must same
Method Signature			Must diff											Must same
Return type					No-restriction										Co-varient type
Private, static, final		Can be overloaded									Can not be overridden
Access modifier				No-restriction										Scope of access modifier cann't be reduced
Throws clause				No-restriction										Some restriction for checked exception
Method resolution			Take care by compiler based on reference type		Take care by JVM based on run-time object
Other name					CTP/SB/EB											RTP/DB/LB


SCJP Questions
public void m1(int x) throws IOException
	1)public void m1(int i)	//Overriding
	2)public static int m1(long l)	//Overloading
	3)public static void m1(int i)	//Not overriding
	4)public void m1(int i) throws Exception  //Not overriding
	5)public static abstract void m1(double d)	//CTE:illigle combination of modifiers
	

Why can't static methods be abstract?
Because "abstract" means: "Implements no functionality", and "static" means: "There is functionality even if you don't have an object instance". 
And that's a logical contradiction.

Polymorphism
	One name but multiple forms is the concept of polymorphism.
	Example- Yourself , diff color u show, 
			 With parent- very innocent
			 With friend-  cinema, park

Example 1:
Method name is the same  but we can apply for different type of arguments(Overloading).
	abs(int)
	abs(long)
	abs(float)

Example 2:
Method signature is same but in parent class, one type of implementation and in child class another type of implementation(Overriding).
Example: fancy name can be taken
	class P{
		public void m1(){
			System.out.println("Subha laxmi");
		}
	}
	class C extends P{
		public void m1(){
			System.out.println("Shrilata/Naintara");
		}
	}
	
Example 3:
Uses of parent reference to hold child object is the concept of polymorphism.
	List l = new AL();
	List l = new LL();
	List l = new Stack();
	List l = new Vector();
Parent class reference can be used to hold child object but by using that reference, 
we can call only the methods available in parent class. And we cannâ€™t call child specific method.
	P p1 = new C();
	p1.m1();
	p1.m2();//CE: cannot find symbol: method m2() location class P

But by using child reference we can call both parent & child class methods.
	C c = new C();
	c.m1();
	c.m2();

When we should go for parent reference to hold child object
If we donâ€™t know , exact type of runtime object , then we should go for parent reference.
Example 1:
	Object o = l.get(o); 
	
Example 2:
	public List m1(){
	.
	.
	AL/LL/Vector/Stack
	}
	List l = m1();
	
C c=new C();																P p=new C();
AL al=new AL();																L l=new AL();
We can this approach if we know exact type of runtime object.				We can this approach if we donâ€™t know exact type of runtime object. 
																			This is the advantage of this approach.
																			
By using child reference we can call both parent & child class method. 		By using parent reference we can call only method available
This is the advantage of this approach.									 	in parent class & we cannâ€™t call child specific methods. 
																			This is the disadvantage of this approach.
																			
We can use child reference to hold only particular child of object. 		We can use parent reference to hold any child class object. 
This is the disadvantage of this approach.									This is the advantage of this approach.


3 Pillars of OOPs
	Encapsulation(Security)
	Inheritance(Code re-usability)
	Polymorphism(Flexibility)
	
Type of polymorphism
	Static polymorphism/ Compile-time polymorphism/ Early binding
		1)Overloading
		2)Method hiding
	Dynamic polymorphism/ Run-time polymorphism/ Late binding
		1)Overriding
	
	
Beautiful definition of polymorphism
	A boy starts love with a word friendship, but girl end love with same word friendship. 
	Word is the same but attitude is the different.
	This beautiful concept of OOPs is nothing but polymorphism.	

Concrete Methods 
A concrete method means, the method have complete definition but it can be overridden in the inherited class. 
Concrete Methods can be overridden in the inherited classes if they are not final.
If we make this method final, then it can not be overridden. 
	Declaring method or class “final” means it’s implementation is complete. 
It is compulsory to override the abstract methods.
