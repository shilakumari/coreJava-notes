Parameter type/type parameter/type variables vs type argument
Multiple Parameter Type

UnBounded Types
Bounded Types using extends

Multiple Parameter Type
Based on our requirement we can declare any number of type parameters 
	& all these type parameter should be separated with ,.
	Class A<A,B,C> {}
	
UnBounded Types
As the type parameter, we can pass any type and there are no restrictions. And hence it is Unbounded type. 
  Class A<E,U,V> {}

Bounded Types
We can bound the type parameter for a particular range using extends keyword. Such types are called bounded types.
  Class A<T extends Number & Runnable & Comparable > {}

Syntax for bounded type:
Class Test<T extends X>
Here X can be either class or interface. If X is a class then as the type parameter we can pass either X type or its child classes.
If X is an interface then as the type parameter we can pass either X type or its implementation classes.
Here the Type parameter T, we can take any valid identifier but convention is to use T.

Example       
Class Test<T extends Number>
{
public void m1()
{
T a,b; 
System.out.println(a+b);
System.out.println(a*b);
System.out.println(a/b);
}
}



Rules for 
1)
We can define bounded types only by using extends keyword and we cannt use implements and super keywords. 
But we can replace implements keyword purpose with extends keyword.
Class A<T extends Number> {}
Class A<T extends Runnable> {}
Class A<T implements Runnable> {}//invalid
Class A<T super String> {}//invalid
2)
Class A<T extends Runnable & Number > {} //invalid, Interface must be after class, if class exist
Class A<T extends Runnable & Comparable> {}
3)
Class A<T extends Number & Thread> {} //invalid, cannt extends more than 1 class
Class A<T extends Number & Runnable & Comparable > {}




Generic class & generic method
We can declare the type parameter , either at class level or at method level.
     Declaring type parameter at class level, 
        class Test<T>{}
        We can use T within this class, based on our requirement.
     Declaring type parameter at method level (we have to declare type parameter, just before return type).
        class Test<T>{public <T> void m1(T obj){}}
        We can use T within this method, based on our requirement.
     
  Bounded type at method level
        We can define bounded type, even at method level also. 


Generic class & generic method
      class Test<T>{
            //we can use 'T' within that class based on our requirement
      }
      class Test{
            public <T>void m1(T ob){
            //We can use 'T' anywhere within this method based on our requirement
            }
      }
 
We can declare the type parameter , either at class level or at method level.
Declaring type parameter at class level, 
      class Test<T>{}
      We can use T within this class, based on our requirement.
Declaring type parameter at method level (we have to declare type parameter, just before return type).
      class Test<T>{
            public <T> void m1(T obj){
            }
      }
      We can use T within this method, based on our requirement.

Bounded type at method level
We can define bounded type, even at method level also. 
<T> void m1()
<T extends Number>
<T extends Runnable>
<T extends Runnable & Number>
<T extends Comparable & Runnable>
<T extends Number & Comparable & Runnable>
<T extends Runnable & Number>//Invalid First we have to take class and then interface
<T extends Number & Thread>//Invalid We can't extends more than one class       
A type variable with multiple bounds is a subtype of all the types listed in the bound. 

In addition to limiting the types you can use to instantiate a generic type, 
	bounded type parameters allow you to invoke methods defined in the bounds:
public class NaturalNumber<T extends Integer> {
    private T t;
    public NaturalNumber(T t)  { this.t = t; }
    public boolean isEven() {
        return t.intValue() % 2 == 0;
    }
    // ...
}
The isEven method invokes the intValue method defined in the Integer class through t.






Generic Methods and Bounded Type Parameters
Bounded type parameters are key to the implementation of generic algorithms. 
Consider the following method that counts the number of elements in an array T[] that are greater than a specified element elem.
public static <T> int countGreaterThan(T[] anArray, T elem) {
    int count = 0;
    for (T e : anArray)
        if (e > elem)  // compiler error
            ++count;
    return count;
}
The implementation of the method is straightforward, 
	but it does not compile because the greater than operator (>) applies only to primitive types such as short, int, double, long, float, byte, and char. 
	You cannot use the > operator to compare objects. 
	To fix the problem, use a type parameter bounded by the Comparable<T> interface:
public interface Comparable<T> {
    public int compareTo(T o);
}
The resulting code will be:
public static <T extends Comparable<T>> int countGreaterThan(T[] anArray, T elem) {
    int count = 0;
    for (T e : anArray)
        if (e.compareTo(elem) > 0)
            ++count;
    return count;
}
