Generic
Purpose/Objective of Generic


Generic
	Generic is a mechanishm to provide type checking at compile time
	Generic type parameters are applicable only with instance field, but not with static field.

Purpose/Objective of Generic
	Stronger type checking 
	to provide Type safety at compile-time and 
	to resolve type casting problem.  
	Code Reuse: We can write a method/class/interface once and use for any type we want.
	Implementing generic algorithms:
		By using generics, we can implement algorithms that work on different types of objects 
		and at the same they are type  safe too.

Case 1: Type Safety
String[] s=new String[1000];
S[0]="Abhinav";
S[1]="Rahul";
S[2]="Ravi";
//S[3]=new Integer(10);//CTE, Incompatible type
S[3]="Shiva";
Whenever a homogeneous or a  particular type of elements are  required , it is highly recommended to use array.
Arrays are type safe(we can give the guarranty for the type of elements presents inside the array 
hence arrays are safe to use with respect to type that is array are type safe.
but collections are not type safe. 

For example, if our programming requirement is to hold only String type of objects, we can choose String array. 
By mistake if we are trying to add any other type of objects, we will get CTE. And we can correct it. 
Hence String array can contain only String type of objects . 
Due to this, we can give the guarantee for the type of elements present inside array. 
Hence arrays are safe to use w.r.t type. That is array are type safe.

ArrayList al=new ArrayList();
Al.add("Abhinav");
Al.add("Rahul");
Al.add("Ravi");
Al.add(new Integer(10));//NO CTE

String name1=(String)al.get(0);
String name2=(String)al.get(1);
String name3=(String)al.get(2);
String name4=(String)al.get(3);//RE,ClassCastException
Failing the program at runtime is more dangerous than the failing the program at compile-time. 
Because at runtime control is not in the programmer"s hand.  Already handover to the client. 
At runtime , failing the program is ultimate , client gives left & right.
But collections are not type safe. That is we cannot give the guarantee for the type of elements presents inside collection.
For example, If our programming requirement is to hold only String type of objects & 
if we choose ArrayList, by mistake, 
if we are trying to add any other type of object, we won"t get any CTE but the program may fail at runtime. 
Hence we cannot give the guarantee for the type of elements present inside collection. 
Due to this collections are not safe to use w.r.t. type. 
That is collections are not type safe.

Array are type safe
Normal collection(without generic) are not type safe.
We want type safety and we don"t know size in advance then we use generics with collection.

Case 2: Type Casting
String s=new String[1000];
S[0]="Abhinav";
String name1=s[0];//Type-Casting not required

ArrayList al=new ArrayList("Abhinav");
al.add("Abhinav");
String name1=al.get(0);//CTE,incompatible type
String name1=(String)al.get(0);// type-casting is mandatory
In the case of arrays, at the time of retrieval, it is not required to perform type casting. 
	Because there is a guarantee for the type of the elements present inside array.
But in the case of collections, at the time of retrieval, it is mandatory to perform type casting. 
	Because there is no guarantee for the type of the elements present inside collection.
Hence type casting is bigger headache in collections.

To overcome above problems of collections, SUN people introduce generic concept in 1.5v. 
Hence the main objective of generics are 
	to provide Type safety and 
	to resolve type casting problem.  

Non Generics version of ArrayList object
ArrayList al=new ArrayList();
al.add("Abhinav");
al.add(new Integer(10));//NO CTE
al.add("Shiv");

Non Generics version of ArrayList object
To hold only String type of objects, we can create generic version of ArrayList object as follows
ArrayList<String> al=new ArrayList<String>();
al.add("Abhinav");
al.add(new Integer(10));//CTE, incompatible type
al.add("Shiv");
For this ArrayList, we can add only String type of object, by mistake if we are trying to add any other type 
then we will get CTE. Hence through generics, we are getting type safety.

At the time of retrieval, we are not required to perform type casting.
ArrayList<String> al=new ArrayList<String>();
al.add("Abhinav");
//al.add(new Integer(10));//CTE, incompatible type
al.add("Shiv");
String name1=l.get(0);//Type-casting is not required.
Hence through generics we can solve type-casting problem.

ArrayList al=new ArrayList() & ArrayList<String> al=new ArrayList<String>()
1)Non-generic version of ArrayList object		
Generic version of ArrayList object
2)For this ArrayList we can add any type of object & hence it is not Type-safe.	
For this ArrayList we can add only String type of object & hence it is Type-safe.
3)At the time of retrieval, we have to perform Type-casting.	
At the time of retrieval, we are not required to performType-casting.

Note 1:	
Polymorphism concept is applicable only for the base type but not for the parameter type.
Using a parent reference to hold child object is the concept of polymorphism.
Figure: Tree of collection framework
List l=new ArrayList();
List l=new LinkedList();
List l=new Vector();
List l=new Stack();

ArrayList<String> l=new ArrayList();//Base type is ArrayList and Parameter Type is String.
List<String> l=new ArrayList<String>();
Collection<String> l=new ArrayList<String>();
ArrayList<Object> l=new ArrayList<String>();//CTE, incompatible type
Polymorphism concept is applicable only for the base type but not for the parameter type.

Note 2:	
For the type parameter we can provide any class or interface name but not primitive. 
If we are trying to provide primitive then we will get CTE. 
ArrayList<int> x=new ArrayList<int>();//CTE, unexpected type


Collections cannot hold primitive type value.
Type parameters are also called type variables.
A type variable can be any non-primitive type you specify: any class type, any interface type, any array type, or even another type variable.

Compile-time bugs, for example, can be detected early on; you can use the compiler's error messages 
	to figure out what the problem is and fix it, right then and there. 
Runtime bugs, however, can be much more problematic; they don't always surface immediately, and when they do, 
	it may be at a point in the program that is far removed from the actual cause of the problem.
Generics add stability to your code by making more of your bugs detectable at compile time. 

Type Parameter Naming Conventions
The most commonly used type parameter names are:
E - Element (used extensively by the Java Collections Framework)
K - Key
N - Number
T - Type
V - Value
S,U,V etc. - 2nd, 3rd, 4th types

Type Parameter and Type Argument Terminology: 
Many developers use the terms "type parameter" and "type argument" interchangeably, but these terms are not the same. 
When coding, one provides type arguments in order to create a parameterized type. 
Therefore, the T in Foo<T> is a type parameter and the String in Foo<String> f is a type argument. 
This lesson observes this definition when using these terms.

The Diamond
In Java SE 7 and later, you can replace the type arguments required to invoke the constructor of a generic class 
	with an empty set of type arguments (<>) as long as the compiler can determine, or infer, the type arguments from the context. 
This pair of angle brackets, <>, is informally called the diamond. 
For example, you can create an instance of Box<Integer> with the following statement:
Box<Integer> integerBox = new Box<>();
For more information on diamond notation and type inference, see Type Inference.
	https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/genTypeInference.html
	
Parameterized Types
You can also substitute a type parameter (i.e., K or V) with a parameterized type (i.e., List<String>). 
For example, using the OrderedPair<K, V> example:
	OrderedPair<String, Box<Integer>> p = new OrderedPair<>("primes", new Box<Integer>(...));


Raw Types
A raw type is the name of a generic class or interface without any type arguments. For example, given the generic Box class:
public class Box<T> {
    public void set(T t) { /* ... */ }
    // ...
}
To create a parameterized type of Box<T>, you supply an actual type argument for the formal type parameter T:
Box<Integer> intBox = new Box<>();
If the actual type argument is omitted, you create a raw type of Box<T>:
Box rawBox = new Box();
Therefore, Box is the raw type of the generic type Box<T>. However, a non-generic class or interface type is not a raw type.
Raw types show up in legacy code because lots of API classes (such as the Collections classes) were not generic prior to JDK 5.0. 
When using raw types, you essentially get pre-generics behavior — a Box gives you Objects. 
For backward compatibility, assigning a parameterized type to its raw type is allowed:
Box<String> stringBox = new Box<>();
Box rawBox = stringBox;               // OK
But if you assign a raw type to a parameterized type, you get a warning:
Box rawBox = new Box();           // rawBox is a raw type of Box<T>
Box<Integer> intBox = rawBox;     // warning: unchecked conversion
You also get a warning if you use a raw type to invoke generic methods defined in the corresponding generic type:
Box<String> stringBox = new Box<>();
Box rawBox = stringBox;
rawBox.set(8);  // warning: unchecked invocation to set(T)
The warning shows that raw types bypass generic type checks, deferring the catch of unsafe code to runtime. 
Therefore, you should avoid using raw types.
The Type Erasure section has more information on how the Java compiler uses raw types.

RawType is not recommended to use.
In place of RawType we should use Generic type with Object as a type parameter.
 
Unchecked Error Messages
As mentioned previously, when mixing legacy code with generic code, you may encounter warning messages similar to the following:
Note: Example.java uses unchecked or unsafe operations.
Note: Recompile with -Xlint:unchecked for details.
This can happen when using an older API that operates on raw types, as shown in the following example:
public class WarningDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Box<Integer> bi;
        bi = createBox();
    }
    static Box createBox(){
        return new Box();
    }
}
The term "unchecked" means that the compiler does not have enough type information to perform all type checks necessary to ensure type safety. 
The "unchecked" warning is disabled, by default, though the compiler gives a hint. To see all "unchecked" warnings, recompile with -Xlint:unchecked.
Recompiling the previous example with -Xlint:unchecked reveals the following additional information:
WarningDemo.java:4: warning: [unchecked] unchecked conversion
found   : Box
required: Box<java.lang.Integer>
        bi = createBox();
                      ^
1 warning
To completely disable unchecked warnings, use the -Xlint:-unchecked flag. The @SuppressWarnings("unchecked") annotation suppresses unchecked warnings. 
If you are unfamiliar with the @SuppressWarnings syntax, see Annotations.
