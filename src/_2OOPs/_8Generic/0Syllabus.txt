Introduction
	Objective of generics
		to provide Type safety and 
		to resolve type casting problem.  
		Code Reuse: We can write a method/class/interface once and use for any type we want.
		Implementing generic algorithms: By using generics, we can implement algorithms that work on different types of objects 
			and at the same they are type safe too.Bounded type parameters are key to the implementation of generic algorithms. 
	Parameter type/type parameter/type variables vs type argument
	Raw Types
	
	Parameter type
		Unbounded type
		Bounded Types 
			Only extends, not implements or super keyword
			Class A<T extends Runnable & Comparable> {}
			<T extends Runnable & Number>//Invalid First we have to take class and then interface
			<T extends Number & Thread>//Invalid We can't extends more than one class       
			A type variable with multiple bounds is a subtype of all the types listed in the bound. 
			Bounded type parameters allow you to invoke methods defined in the bounds:
				public class NaturalNumber<T extends Integer> {
    				private T t;
    				public NaturalNumber(T t)  { this.t = t; }
    				public boolean isEven() {
        			return t.intValue() % 2 == 0;}
				The isEven method invokes the intValue method defined in the Integer class through t.
			Generic Methods and Bounded Type Parameters
				Bounded type parameters are key to the implementation of generic algorithms. 
				public static <T extends Comparable<T>> int countGreaterThan(T[] anArray, T elem) {
			We can define bounded type, even at method level also.
			Polymorphism concept is applicable only for the base type but not for the parameter type.
			
Generic Classes or template classes
Generic Methods 
Note: Given two concrete types A and B (for example, Number and Integer), MyClass<A> has no relationship to MyClass<B>, 
	regardless of whether or not A and B are related. 
	The common parent of MyClass<A> and MyClass<B> is Object.
interface PayloadList<E,V> extends List<E> {
  void setPayload(int index, V val);}
The following parameterizations of PayloadList are subtypes of List<String>:
PayloadList<String,String>
PayloadList<String,Integer>
PayloadList<String,Exception>

Type Inference and Generic Methods
Generic Methods introduced you to type inference, 
which enables you to invoke a generic method as you would an ordinary method, 
without specifying a type between angle brackets. 
  BoxDemo.<Integer>addBox(Integer.valueOf(10), listOfIntegerBoxes);
    BoxDemo.addBox(Integer.valueOf(20), listOfIntegerBoxes);
Type Inference and Instantiation of Generic Classes
	You can replace the type arguments required to invoke the constructor of a generic class 
	with an empty set of type parameters (<>) as long as the compiler can infer the type arguments from the context. 
	This pair of angle brackets is informally called the diamond.
Type Inference and Generic Constructors of Generic and Non-Generic Classes
	class MyClass<X> {
  <T> MyClass(T t) {
    // ... }}
	new MyClass<Integer>("")
