/* CountDownLatches
 * This is used to synchronize one or more tasks by forcing them to wait 
	for the completion of a set of operations being performed by other tasks
 * 
 * 		- You give an initial count to a CountDownLatch object, and any task that calls await()
 * 				on that object will block until the count reaches zero
 * 
 * 		- Other tasks may call countDown() on the object to reduce the count, presumably when a task finishes its job
 * 		- A CountDownLatch is designed to be used in a one-shot fashion; the count cannot be reset !!!
 * 				If you need a version that resets the count, you can use a CyclicBarrier instead
 * 
 * 		- The tasks that call countDown() are not blocked when they make that call. 
					Only the call to await() is blocked until the count reaches zero
 * 		A typical use is to divide a problem into n independently solvable tasks and create a CountDownLatch with a value of n.
 * 		When each task is finished it calls countDown() on the latch. Tasks waiting for the problem to be solved call await() 
 * 		on the latch to hold themselves back until it is completed
 *
