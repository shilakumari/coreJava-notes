Problems  in OOP
	Everything is an object
	All code blocks are associated with classes &  objects
	We cann't have piece of logic/function in isolation


Passing behavior in OOPs
What if I want just a function?
1)
	Class Greeter{
		Psvm(){
			Greeter greeter=new Greeter();
			greeter.greet();
		}
		public void greet(){
			System.out.println("Hello World");
		}
	}

2)
We are passing a thing/object that has behavior/action.
Public void greet(action){
	action();
}
public class Greeter  {
	public void greet(Greeting greeting) {
		greeting.perform();
	}
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Greeter greeter = new Greeter();
		HelloWorldGreeting helloWorldGreeting = new HelloWorldGreeting();
		
		greeter.greet(helloWorldGreeting);
		
		greeter.greet(  new Greeting() {
			public void perform() {
				System.out.println("Anonymous classs");
			}
		});
	}
}
interface Greeting {
	void perform();
}
class HelloWorldGreeting implements Greeting {
	public void perform() {
		System.out.println("HeeloWorldGreeting");
	}
}

Inline String & number  values
String name="foo";
Double pi=3.14;

Functions as Values
aBlockOfCode=void show(){
	SOP("Hello World");
}

aBlockOfCode=  () ->{ 	SOP("Hello World");}
aBlockOfCode=  () ->SOP("Hello World");
  
greet(aBlockOfCode);
greet(() ->SOP("Hello World"));

greetingFunction=()->SOP("Hello World");
greet(greetingFunction);
greet(() ->SOP("Hello World"));

doubleNumberFunction=(int a)->{return a*2};
doubleNumberFunction=(int a)->return a*2;//Invalid
doubleNumberFunction=(int a)-> a*2;
It is invalid to specify the return keyword when we have a one-linear lambda expression without {}. 


addFunction=(int a,int b)->a+b;
safeDivideFunction=(int a,int b)->{ 
if(b==0) return 0;  
return a/b;}


interface X1{ public int (Object s);}
X1 stringLengthFunction1=(String s)->s.length();//CTE,Lambda expression's parameter s is expected to be of type Object
interface X2{  public int (String s);}
X2 stringLengthFunction2=(String s)->s.length();

 
Lambda as Interface type
interface MyAdd{
	int add(int a,int b);
}
MyAdd  addFunction=(int a,int b)->a+b;
System.out.println(addFunction.add(1,11));


Lambda vs interface implementations
Psvm()
{ 
	Greeter greeter=new Greeter();
	Greeting heloWorldGreeting=new HeloWorldGreeting();
	heloWorldGreeting.perform();//Hello World
	greeter.greet(heloWorldGreeting);//Hello World

	Greeting innerClassGreeting=new Greeting(){Public void perform(){	SOP("Hello World");}};
	innerClassGreeting.perform();//Hello World
	greeter.greet(innerClassGreeting);();//Hello World

	Greeting myLambdaFunction=()->{System.out.println("HeeloWorldLambdaExpression");};
	myLambdaFunction.perform();//This is how we execute lambda expression. 
							  //By calling the interface method on it, just as if it were an instance of a class.
	greeter.greet(myLambdaFunction);
	greeter.greet(()->{System.out.println("HeeloWorldLambdaExpression");});



Type inference
1)greeter.greet(()->{System.out.println("HeeloWorldLambdaExpression");});
2) StringLengthLambda stringLengthLambda=(String s)->s.length();
  System.out.println(stringLengthLambda.getLength("Hello World"));
		
  stringLengthLambda=(s)->s.length();
  System.out.println(stringLengthLambda.getLength("Hello World2"));
		
  stringLengthLambda=s->s.length();//if argument is single
  System.out.println(stringLengthLambda.getLength("Hello World3"));

class TypeInferenceExample{
	Psvm(){
		StringLengthLambda  myLambda= (String s)->s.length();
		StringLengthLambda  myLambda= (s)->s.length();
		StringLengthLambda  myLambda= s->s.length();
		printLambda(s->s.length());
		SOP(myLambda.getLength("Hello Lambda"));//12
	}
	Public static void printLambda(StringLengthLambda  l){
		SOP(l.getLength("Hello Lambda"));
	}
	Interface StringLengthLambda{
		int getLength(String s);
	}
}

Runnable Using Lambdas	
For backward compatibility there is not created a new type for Lambda.
They use interface type for a lambda expression.

Runnable is a functional interface.
Thread myLambdaThread=new Thread(()->{System.out.println("myLambdaThread");});
myLambdaThread.run();
myLambdaThread.start();

Functional interface
Only one abstract method. It may or may not  have default  functions.
@FunctionalInterface 
The @FunctionalInterface annotation is completely optional. The java compiler does not require it for our lambda types.
	But it is good practice to add it. 



Annoymous Inner Class vs Lambda Expression
Lambda Expression doesn"t come as a replacement of anonymous inner class.
Annoymous Inner Class != Lambda Expression
1)It is a class without name. 
	It is a function without name.
2)It can extend abstract and concrete classes.
      It cann"t.
3)It can implements an interface that contains any number of abstract methods. 
     It can implements an interface which contains single abstract   method(functional interface).
4)Inside it we can declare instance variables. 
      Inside it we cann"t.
5)It can be instantiated. 
      It cann"t.
6)Inside it, this always refers current anonymous inner class object but not outer class object. 
     Inside it, this always refers current outer class object, i.e. enclosing class object.
7)It is best choice if we want to handle multiple methods. 
      It is best choice if we want to handle interface with single abstract method(Functional interface).
8) For it, at the time of compilation, a separate .class file will be created. 
   For it, there willn"t.
9)Memory will be located on demand whenever we are creating its object. 
  It will reside in permanent memory of JVM(method area).

From lambda expression, we can access enclosing class variable and enclosing method variable directly.
Local variable  referenced from lambda expression must be  final or effectively final.

interface Interf
{
	public void m1();
}
public class Test {
      int x=10;
	public void m2()
	{
		int y=20;
		
		Interf interf=()->{//Clousre block
			System.out.println(x);
			System.out.println(y);
		};
		interf.m1();
	}
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Test t1=new Test();
		t1.m2();

	}
}





What is Lambda Expression
	Lambda Expression is just an anonymous(Nameless) Function or closure.
	Lambda Expression doesn"t have
		Name
		Return type
		Access modifier


Ex 1:
public void m1()
{
	SOP("Hello");
}
()->{	SOP("Hello");}
()->SOP("Hello");


Ex 2:
Type inference
public void m1(int a, int b)
{
	SOP("Hello" +(a+b));
}
 (a, b)->{	SOP("Hello" +(a+b));}
 (a, b)->SOP("Hello" +(a+b));


Ex 3:
public int squareIt(int x)
{
	return x*x;
}
(x)->{	return x*x;}
x->	return x*x;//invalid
x->x*x;

Conclusions

LambdaExercise.java

public class LambdaExercise {
public static void main(String[] args) {
}
// Step 1: Sort list by last name
// Step 2: Create a method that prints all elements in the list
// Step 3: Create a method that prints all people that have last name beginning with C
}
class Person {
	private String firstName;
	private String lastName;
	private int age;
	//Parameterized Constructor
	//getter & setters
	//toString()
}







Lambda Expression
Lambda Expression is just an anonymous (nameless) function or closures. 
That means the function which doesn't have the name, return type and access modifiers.

Lambda expressions provide below functionalities:
	Enable to treat functionality as a method argument, or code as data.
	A lambda expression can be passed around as if it was an object and executed on demand.
	A function that can be created without belonging to any class.

Lambda calculus is a big change in mathematical world which has been introduced in 1930.
	LISP is the first programming which uses Lambda Expression.
	The other languages which uses lambda expressions are:
 		C#.Net
 		C Objective
 		C
 		C++
 		Python
		Ruby etc.
		and finally in Java also.

Main Objective of Lambda Expression 
	To bring benefits of functional programming into Java

Functional Programming
	More Readable & Maintainable at some situations


What are the advantages of Lambda expression?
	It Enable functional programming in Java
		We can handle procedure/function just like values.
		We can pass  procedure/function as arguments.
	We can reduce length of the code 
		so that readability of the code will be improved.
	We can resolve complexity of anonymous inner classes until some extent..
	We can pass lambda expression as argument to methods.



Ex: 1
public void m1() {sop("hello");} 
() -> { sop("hello");} 
() -> sop("hello");	

Ex:2
public void add(int a, int b) {sop(a+b);}
(int a, int b) -> sop(a+b);

If the type of the parameter can be decided by compiler automatically 
based on the context then we can remove types also.
The above Lambda expression we can rewrite as 
	(a,b) -> sop (a+b);

Ex: 3
public String str(String str) { return str;}
(String str) -> {return str;};
 (str) -> return str;//CTE
 (str) ->  str;//No CTE

Ex4:
Function<String, String> f11 = (str) -> {return str;};
		
Conclusions:
1) A lambda expression can have zero or more number of parameters (arguments).
Ex:
() -> sop("hello");
(int a ) -> sop(a);
(int a, int b) -> {return a+b;};
(int a, int b) -> return a+b;//CTE

2) Usually we can specify type of parameter. 
If the compiler expects the type based on the context then we can remove type. i.e., programmer is not required to specify type.
Ex:
(int a, int b) -> sop(a+b);
 (a,b) -> sop(a+b);
 
3) If zero number of parameters available then we have to use empty parameter [ like ()].
Ex: () -> sop("hello");

4) If only one parameter is available and if the compiler can expect the type then we can remove the type and parenthesis also.
Ex:
(int a) -> sop(a);
(a)-> sop(a);
a -> sop(a);


5) Similar to method body lambda expression body also can contain multiple statements. 
If more than one statements present then we have to enclose inside within curly braces. 
If one statement present then curly braces are optional.
But if one statement is return statement the either we use curly braces or just not write return keyword.
	(String str) -> {return str;};
 (str) -> return str;//CTE
 (str) ->  str;//No CTE
	
6) Once we write lambda expression we can call that expression just like a method, 
but for this functional interfaces are required.
To call lambda expression some type is required. 
That is provided by functional interface.


The lambda expression approach can be used for any suitable interface from old libraries. 
It is usable for interfaces like Runnable, Comparator, and so on. 
However, this doesn't mean that you should review your whole older codebase and change everything.

Function<Integer, Integer> squareFunction = (x) -> x * x;
	Function<Integer, Integer> squareFunction2 = new Function<Integer, Integer>() {
			@Override
			public Integer apply(Integer x) {
				return x*x;
			}
		};
		
		
Predicate<Integer> isEvenPredicate = x -> x%2==0; converted into the following:		
Predicate<Integer> isEvenPredicate2 = new Predicate<Integer>() {
			@Override
			public boolean test(Integer x) {return x%2==0;}	};	


Consumer<Integer> sysoutConsumer = System.out::println;
		Consumer<Integer> sysoutConsumer2 = new Consumer<Integer>() {
			public void accept(Integer x) {
				System.out.println(x);
			}
		};
		
		
		
Examples:
FP03LambdaExpressions.java
	courses.stream().sorted().forEach( (String x) -> System.out.println(x));
	List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(12, 9, 13, 4, 6, 2, 4, 12, 15);
	Integer sum = numbers.stream().reduce(0, (Integer x,Integer y) -> x + y);
	Supplier<Integer> randomSupplier = () -> {
        Random rand = new Random(); 
        return rand.nextInt(1000); 
	};
	System.out.println(randomSupplier.get());
FP03BehaviorParameterization.java
	numbers.stream()
		.filter(predicate)
		.forEach(System.out::println);
	numbers.stream()
		.map(mappingFunction)
		.collect(Collectors.toList());
		
		
MethodReference is simplified version of Lambda.????????
	numbers.stream().filter(predicate).forEach(System.out::print);
	numbers.stream().filter(predicate).forEach((x)->{System.out.print(x);});
	
	
interface X1{ public int abc(Object s);}
interface X2{  public int abc(String s);}
//X1 stringLengthFunction1 = (String s)->s.length();//?????????????CTE
		X2 stringLengthFunction2=(String s)->s.length();
		
		
		
Keep Lambda Expressions Short and Self-explanatory
If possible, use one line constructions instead of a large block of code. 
	Remember lambdas should be an expression, not a narrative. 
	Despite its concise syntax, lambdas should precisely express the functionality they provide.
	This is mainly stylistic advice, as performance will not change drastically. 
		In general, however, it is much easier to understand and to work with such code.
This can be achieved in many ways:
1)Avoid Blocks of Code in Lambda's Body
	Foo foo = parameter -> buildString(parameter);
2)Avoid Specifying Parameter Types
	(a, b) -> a.toLowerCase() + b.toLowerCase();
3)Avoid Parentheses Around a Single Parameter
	Lambda syntax requires parentheses only around more than one parameter or when there is no parameter at all. 
	a -> a.toLowerCase();
4)Avoid Return Statement and Braces
	a -> a.toLowerCase();
5)Use Method References
	Very often, even in our previous examples, lambda expressions just call methods which are already implemented elsewhere. 
	In this situation, it is very useful to use another Java 8 feature: method references.
	So, the lambda expression:
		a -> a.toLowerCase();
		could be substituted by:
		String::toLowerCase;
		This is not always shorter, but it makes the code more readable.
6)Use “Effectively Final” Variables
	Accessing a non-final variable inside lambda expressions will cause the compile-time error. 
		But it doesn’t mean that you should mark every target variable as final.
	According to the “effectively final” concept, a compiler treats every variable as final, 
		as long as it is assigned only once.
	It is safe to use such variables inside lambdas because the compiler will control their state and 
		trigger a compile-time error immediately after any attempt to change them.
	For example, the following code will not compile:
		public void method() {
		    String localVariable = "Local";
		    Foo foo = parameter -> {
		        String localVariable = parameter;
		        return localVariable;
		    };}
		The compiler will inform you that:
			Variable 'localVariable' is already defined in the scope.
	This approach should simplify the process of making lambda execution thread-safe.
7)Protect Object Variables from Mutation
	One of the main purposes of lambdas is use in parallel computing – 
		which means that they're really helpful when it comes to thread-safety.
	The “effectively final” paradigm helps a lot here, but not in every case. 
	Lambdas can't change a value of an object from enclosing scope. 
	But in the case of mutable object variables, a state could be changed inside lambda expressions.
		int[] total = new int[1];
		Runnable r = () -> total[0]++;
		r.run();
		This code is legal, as total variable remains “effectively final”. 
		But will the object it references to have the same state after execution of the lambda? No!
	Keep this example as a reminder to avoid code that can cause unexpected mutations.
