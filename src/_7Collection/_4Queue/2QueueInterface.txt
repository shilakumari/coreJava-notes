Queue(since 1.5v)
It is child interface of Collection interface.
If we want to represent a group of individual objects prior to processing(FIFO) then we should go for Queue.
Ex: Before sending a mail all mail id’s have to store somewhere and 
	in which order we saved in the same order mail’s should be delivered(FIFO). 
	For this requirement Queue concept is the best choice.

Queue(I,1.5v)
	Deque(I)
		ArrayDeque
		LinkedList
	Priority Queue(1.5v)
	BlockingQueue(1.5v)
		LinkedBlockingQueue(1.5v)
		PriorityBlockingQueue(1.5v)

Usually Queue follow FIFO order but based on our requirement we may implement our own priority order also(PriorityQueue).
From 1.5v onwards LinkedList class also implements Queue interface. 
	LinkedList implementation of Queue always follows FIFO order.//??


Interfaces Collection, List, Set, Queue, SortedSet, NavigableSet etc. meant for representing a group of individual objects. 
	If we want to represent a group of objects as key value pairs then we should go for Map interface.
