Collection
	If we want to represent a group of individual objects as a single entity then we should go for Collection.
	Collection interface defines the most common method which are applicable for any collection object. 
	Collections are used to hold & transfer objects across network.
	
	Between class & interface , interface provide more information. 
	Class is a dummy thing which implement interface. 
	In interface total information will be there.
	
	In general Collection interface is considered as root interface of collection framework.
		Although map is also considered as part of collection framework.
	
	Iterable(I)
		Collection(I)
	Collection interface extends Iterable interface. 
		Implementing Iterable interface allows an object to be the target of the "for-each loop" statement.
		
	
	There is no concrete class which implements Collection interface directly.
	All collections are generic. And it is recommended to use generic collection.
	
	
Methods of Collection interface
Collection interface does not contain any method to retrieve objects. 

boolean add(E e)
	Ensures that this collection contains the specified element (optional operation).
	
boolean addAll(Collection<? extends E> c)
	Adds all of the elements in the specified collection to this collection (optional operation).


boolean	remove(Object o)
	Removes a single instance of the specified element from this collection, if it is present (optional operation).
	
boolean	removeAll(Collection<?> c)
	Removes all of this collection's elements that are also contained in the specified collection (optional operation).

boolean	retainAll(Collection<?> c)
	Retains only the elements in this collection that are contained in the specified collection (optional operation).
	
boolean contains(Object o)
	Returns true if this collection contains the specified element.

boolean containsAll(Collection<?> c)
	Returns true if this collection contains all of the elements in the specified collection.

int	size()
	Returns the number of elements in this collection.
boolean	isEmpty()
	Returns true if this collection contains no elements.
void clear()
	Removes all of the elements from this collection (optional operation).


Object[] toArray()
	Returns an array containing all of the elements in this collection.

<T> T[]	toArray(T[] a)
	Returns an array containing all of the elements in this collection; 
		the runtime type of the returned array is that of the specified array.
	Note that toArray(new Object[0]) is identical in function to toArray().
	
default Stream<E>	stream()
	Returns a sequential Stream with this collection as its source.
default Stream<E>	parallelStream()
	Returns a possibly parallel Stream with this collection as its source.
default boolean	removeIf(Predicate<? super E> filter)
	Removes all of the elements of this collection that satisfy the given predicate.


Methos from Object class
boolean	equals(Object o)
	Compares the specified object with this collection for equality.
int	hashCode()
	Returns the hash code value for this collection.


Methods from Interface Iterable<T>:
Iterator<E>	iterator()
	Returns an iterator over the elements in this collection.
default Spliterator<E>	spliterator()
	Creates a Spliterator over the elements in this collection.
default void forEach(Consumer<? super T> action)
	Performs the given action for each element of the Iterable until 
		all elements have been processed or 
			the action throws an exception. 
		Unless otherwise specified by the implementing class, 
			actions are performed in the order of iteration (if an iteration order is specified). 
		Exceptions thrown by the action are relayed to the caller.
	The	default implementation behaves as if:
     		for(T t : this)
        		action.accept(t);
