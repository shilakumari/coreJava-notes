Short notes
Need of Collection
	1)Individual variable approach(Not feasible approach for long list of elements for operations (like searching,sorting etc) , int x=10;int y=20;Readability problem)
	2)Array approach(fixed in size,Heterogeneous not allowed, not underlying DS available)
	
Solution: 3)Collection approach:Grow-able in nature,Heterogeneous allowed,Underlying DS available
			
List(I)
	ArrayList:
		Underlying DS(re-sizable array Or grow-able array),Duplicates & Insertion(null also) order is preserved.
		Const.(3)->ArrayList al=new ArrayList()/new ArrayList(int initialCapacity)/new ArrayList(Collection c).
			//default initial capacity=10 	&	New capacity=(current capacity*3/2)+1=16
		ArrayList & Vector implements RandomAccess(I).
	LinkedList:
		Underlying DS(doubly-linked list),Insertion(null also) order preserved,Duplicates are allowed.

		







Need or purpose of a collection
1)Individual variable approach
	int x=10;
	int y=20;
	int z=30;
	Readability problem
	Not feasible approach for long list of elements for operations (like searching,sorting etc)
2)Array approach
	Student[] st=new Student[1000];
Advantage
	Using single variable, we can represent multiple values
	Readability improved


Limitations of array:
	1)Array are fixed in size. Once we created an array with some size 
		there is no chance of increasing or decreasing the size based on requirement. 
		To use arrays compulsory we should know the size in advance, which may not possible always. 
		Like for seminar we taken big hall but at runtime only 2 person came.
	2)Homogeneous data element
		St[0]=new Student();
		St[1]=new Customer();//CTE, incompatible type
			Found:Customer
			Required:Student

		Object[] obj=new Object[10000];
		obj[0]=new Student();
		obj[1]=new Customer(); 
	3)Array concept is not implemented based on some standard data structure.   
		Therefore underline data structure is not there for array. 
		Ready-made methods support we cannot expect. For every requirement, compulsory we are responsible to write the code.
		For example: If we want to insert element in sorting order then we have to write code for this.
		For every requirement, in collection we can expect ready-made method support. 

3)Collection approach
	Grow-able in nature
		Based on our requirement we can increase or decrease the size.
	Homogeneous & Heterogeneous objects allowed.
	Every collection class is implemented based on some standard data structure.
		Hence ready-made method support is available. 
	
	Disadvantage: 
		Slow performance compare to array but better w.r.t. Memory
		Only allowed Object, not primitive

Difference b/w array & collection
	Collection concept is not up to the mark according to performance.But collection is better w.r.t. memory.
	In collection we can store only object but not primitive data type.
	
	It is highly recommended to use array not collection if initial sized is known in advance.

Collection
It is a group of individual objects, represented as a single entity. 
If we want to represent a group of individual objects as a single entity then we should go for collection.

Collection stores only object not primitive type.
All collections are generic.

Collection Framework
It defines several classes & interfaces which can be used to represent a group of objects as single entity.

Java 					C++
Collection				Container
Collection Framework	STL( Standard Template Library) 


Library
A group of classes & interfaces.


Overview Of Collection Framework
Collection framework hierarchy
Collection(I 1.2v)
	List(I 1.2v)
		ArrayList(1.2v)
		LinkedList(1.2v)
		Vector(LC 1.0v)
			Stack(LC 1.0v)
	Set(I 1.2v)
		HashSet(1.2v)
			LinkedHashSet(1.4v) 
		SortedSet(1.2v)
			NavigableSet(I 1.6v)
				TreeSet(1.2v)
	Queue(I 1.5v)
		Deque(I)
			ArrayDeque
			LinkedList
		PriorityQueue(I 1.5v)
		BlokingQueue(1.5v)
			PriorityBlokingQueue(1.5v)
			LinkedBlokingQueue(1.5v)

Map(I)
	HashMap(1.2v)
		LinkedHashMap(1.4v)
	WeakHashMap(1.2v)
	IdentityHashMap(1.4v)
	SortedMap(1.2v)
		NavigableMap(1.6v)
			TreeMap(1.2v)
	HashTable(1.0v) ((Child class of abstract class Dictionary(since 1.0v))(since 1.0v))
		Properties(1.0v)
			//HashMap(1.0v)//In 1.0v, but not now






Difference b/w Collection & Collections
Collection is an interface which can be used to represent a group of individual objects as a single entity.
Collections is an utility class present in java.util.package to define several utility methods(like Sorting, Searching..) for Collection objects.


Sorting
	Comparable(I)
	Comparator(I)

Cursors
	Enumeration(I)
	Iterator(I)
	ListIterator(I)

Utility Classes
	Collections
	Arrays
	

The process of creating, exactly duplicate objects,is called cloning.
Most of the time receiver do not perform any operation directly on this object 
	because if something goes wrong then it may not recover. 
	So receiver creates a duplicate object for that object.
	Cloning is very common process for collections.

Usually we can use collection to hold & transfer objects from one place to another place, 
	to provide support for this requirement every collection already implements Serializable & Cloneable interface.
