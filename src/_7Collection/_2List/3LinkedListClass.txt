LinkedList


	Underlying data structure-doubly linked list
	Insertion order preserved
	Duplicates are allowed
	Heterogeneous element allowed
	Null element insertion possible

	LinkedList implements Serializable & Cloneable interfaces but not RandomAccess interface.
	LinkedList implements  Queue & Dequeue interfaces.
	
	For linked list capacity concept is not applicable.

Shifting is not required for insertion and deletion of element. 
	So insertion & deletion in middle will be fast.
Searching is slow because 1st element contains address of second and second contains address of third and so on.
LinkedList is the best choice if our frequent operation is insertion or deletion in middle.
LinkedList is the worst choice if our frequent operation is retrieval operation.



LinkedList constructors
	(1)LinkedList l1 = new LinkedList();
		create an empty LinkedList Object.
	(2)LinkedList l1 = new LinkedList(Collection c);
		Create an equivalent LinkedList Object for the given collection.


LinkedList demo program
import java.util.*;
public class LinkedListDemo{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		LinkedList l1 = new LinkedList();
		l1.add("Ram");
		l1.add(30);
		l1.add(null);
		l1.add("durga");
		l1.set(0, "software");
		l1.add(0, "venkey");
		l1.addFirst("ccc");
		Systm.out.println(l);//[ccc, venkey, software, 30, null]
	}
}

ArrayList vs LinkedList
Underlying data structure-doubly linked list
LinkedList is the best choice if our frequent operation is insertion or deletion in middle.
It does not implement RandomAccess interface
For linked list capacity concept is not applicable.
It also implements Queue interface

DS
(1)Array based
	Stack
	Queue
(2)LinkedList based
	Stack(LIFO)
	Queue(FIFO)


LinkedList
Usually we can use LinkedList to implement stacks and queues and 
to provide support for this requirement LinkedList class defines following specific methods.
	void addFirst();
	void addLast();
	void addFirst(Object o)
	void addLast(Object o)
	Object getFirst();
	Object getLast();
	Object removeFirst();
	Object removeLast();
